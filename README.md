# Planetary-Time
The stars in the sky was once believed (and still is for some) to determine the world events in ways that was violatile. Thales used Astrology to go from poverty to generational wealth by placing money on Olive harvesters when there was no demand for Olive pressers, but when the season demand soared and it was all on the terms of Thales. (this is called Options Trading... without the Astrology of course)

Before advanced telescopes were invented, only Seven planets were known to the ancient world. These Seven Planets, or known as the Chaldean Order, played a major role in high society from the Babylonians, Egypt, Greece etc.

The Chaldean Order goes as follows:
    Sunday    = Sun
    Monday    = Moon
    Tuesday   = Mars
    Wednesday = Mercury
    Thursday  = Jupiter
    Friday    = Venus
    Saturday  = Saturn

And each hour of the day have their own ruler as well:

The code simply takes in the users input of Day and Time (24-Hour format). The purpose of Planetary Timing can be used in a variety of ways. One of the most common use in Occult tradition is to find the optimal time to execute a ritual.

Now anyone can use this old European system in a variety of ways, whether that be a skeptic wanting to see if there's any correlations, or someone who wants to use it in its original purpose.
